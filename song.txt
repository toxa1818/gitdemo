you shout it loud
but i can’t hear a word you say
i’m talking loud not saying much
i’m criticized but all your bull is brick of shame
you shoot me down, but i get up
[chorus]
i’m bulletproof nothing to lose
fire away, fire away
brick of shame, take your rain
fire away, fire away
you shoot me down but i won’t fall
i am titanium
you shoot me down but i won’t fall
i am titanium
i am titanium…
