you shout it loud
but i can’t hear a word you say
i’m talking loud not saying much
i’m criticized but all your bull is brick of shame
you shoot me down, but i get up
[chorus]
i’m bulletproof nothing to lose
fire away, fire away
brick of shame, take your rain
fire away, fire away
you shoot me down but i won’t fall
i am titanium
you shoot me down but i won’t fall
i am titanium
i am titanium…

cut me down
but is you who had offered there to fall
ghost town, haunted love
raise your voice, sticks and stones may break my bones
i’m talking loud not saying much
[chorus]
i’m bulletproof nothing to lose
fire away, fire away
brick of shame, take your rain
fire away, fire away
you shoot me down but i won’t fall
i am titanium
you shoot me down but i won’t fall
i am titanium
i am titanium…
